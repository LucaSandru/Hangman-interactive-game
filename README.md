# Hangman
## Why was this project created?
  **This project** was created in order to practice skills about Python, randomness and better experience with user that play this game
## Inspiration
  This project was inspired by playing from a young age this game with my friends. So, once I learned basics of *Python*, I implement this game on 'screen world', not just on a paper
## Description
  **This Python program** makes an interactive connection with user and, once user set difficulty of the word, he/she has to find *the random given word*.
  This **'game'** has to be played exclusively on terminal, is not in fact a game, just a simulation of it.
  User can **win** or **lose**.
## How to install and Run the project
  1. Open the terminal and write **install python 3.11**.If you have this already installed, go to step 2
  2. In the same terminal, use command **pip install** and *a pip extension* will be created. If you have installed already, is better to command it to verify
  3. Now, Python is installed successfully on your PC
     Observation: If the steps are not clear, visit this link: [https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/msi/](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/msi/)
  5. You have to install **Pycharm**, a Python application ([Click here to install](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)). You can install your preffered Pycharm Edition
  6. Download the file [hangman.py](https://github.com/LucaSandru/Hangman-interactive-game/blob/main/hangman.py)
  7. Open this .py file with Pycharm
  8. Now everything is set, good luck finding the words and hope you will enjoy!
## Credits
  This program was also inspired from a course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/?gad_source=1&utm=f20108f9855c4a308f1260d1930f7981&track=1&pt=2), which is [100 days of Python](https://www.udemy.com/share/103J8C3@b8_n-2JHMT2gShhz7l8xfjqa0Rcu3KOnygIPeX_RT87lnwaQc3Kg3obnoymodALrew==/). This course helped me a lot on constructing and managing my own ideas in making a program or an application.
